# Altium MCP Server

Control and query Altium Designer through an MCP client that supports local stdio servers.
This Model Context Protocol (MCP) server exposes tools for inspecting and editing PCB designs, schematics, and libraries through Python and Altium's scripting interface. It runs on Windows and is independent of the agent or model provider.

## Example commands
- Run all output jobs
- Create a symbol for the part in the attached datasheet and use the currently open symbol as a reference example.
- Create a schematic symbol from the attached MPM3650 switching regulator datasheet and make sure to strictly follow the symbol placement rules. (Note: Need to open a schematic library. Uses `server\symbol_placement_rules.txt` in the server's installation directory as pin placement rules. Please modify for your own preferences; an update can replace the file, so keep a copy.)
- Create an op-amp symbol with a triangle body like the other op-amps in my library (symbols support line/polygon/arc/ellipse/label body graphics, not just rectangles)
- Find me the LM358 symbol in my opamp library and open it
- Create a multi-part symbol for a quad op-amp from the attached LM324 datasheet (creates parts A, B, C, D with shared V+/V- power pins)
- Create a PCB footprint for the SMD part in the attached datasheet and add it to my open PcbLib
- Duplicate my selected layout. (Will prompt user to now select destination components. Supports Component, Track, Arc, Via, Polygon, & Region)
- Show all my inner layers. Show the top and bottom layer. Turn off solder paste.
- Get me all parts on my design made by Molex
- Give me the description and part number of U4
- Place the selected parts on my pcb with best practices for a switching regulator, then verify clearances and show me a screenshot of the result
- Auto-place my silkscreen, then fix the designators the placer left on top of parts or far from them
- Give me a list of all IC designators in my design
- Get me all length matching rules
- Check my project is ready for fabrication: unsaved documents, ERC errors, and which layers my Gerber output job plots
- Draw a schematic of an LED with a current-limiting resistor on a new sheet, using symbols from my library
- Edit an existing schematic sheet: add, update or delete components, wires, labels and ports without saving it
- Read the actual schematic pin-to-net map and check expected connections without saving sheets

## Installing the MCP Server

1. Install Python 3.10 to 3.14 on Windows and make sure it is available to your MCP client. Python 3.15 is untested.
2. Clone or download this repository to a local directory.
3. Register the server in your MCP client using the instructions below.

### Codex

With the [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/) installed and available on PATH, run this from the repository directory:

```powershell
python .\start_server.py mcp setup --client codex
```

This runs the official `codex mcp add` command and registers `altium-mcp` with absolute paths to the current Python interpreter and `start_server.py`. It uses Codex's user configuration (`%USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml` by default, or the directory set by `CODEX_HOME`), shared by the desktop app, CLI and IDE extension on the same host. Re-running setup replaces the `altium-mcp` entry; other servers are preserved. If `ALTIUM_MCP_HOME` is set, setup includes its absolute path in the server environment.

Setup only registers the server. Prepare dependencies before the first connection to avoid Codex's startup timeout:

```powershell
python .\start_server.py --build
codex mcp get altium-mcp
```

**Python versions:** 3.10 to 3.13 install the hash-locked `requirements.txt`. 3.14 has no wheel for the locked pillow, so it installs the fallback list in `start_server.py` instead. With `mcp` 1.30 that list no longer caps pydantic, so it also resolves on 3.15, but 3.15 has not been tested.

Restart Codex or reload its MCP servers, then call `get_server_status` to check the connection. Keep the repository at the registered path; run setup again after moving it or changing Python.

If you use the desktop app without the Codex CLI, add this table to your Codex `config.toml` instead, replacing both paths with your actual locations:

```toml
[mcp_servers.altium-mcp]
command = "C:/path/to/python.exe"
args = ["C:/path/to/altium-mcp/start_server.py"]
startup_timeout_sec = 60
```

If the table already exists, update it instead of adding a duplicate. See the [official Codex MCP documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp/) for configuration details.

### Other MCP clients

Configure your MCP client to launch `start_server.py` with Python using the stdio transport. Use an absolute path to the script. If Python is not on the client's PATH, use the full path to `python.exe` as the command.

For clients that use an `mcpServers` configuration, a typical entry looks like this. Other clients may use a different configuration format; the launch command and arguments are the same.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "altium-mcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:/path/to/altium-mcp/start_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the example path with your repository location, then enable or reload the server in your client. Call `get_server_status` to check that the server is connected and Altium was found.

The launcher creates a virtual environment and installs dependencies on first use, which requires network access. To prepare it before connecting the client, run this from the repository directory:

```powershell
python start_server.py --build
```

Use the same Python interpreter and `ALTIUM_MCP_HOME` setting as the client. If a first launch exceeds the client's startup timeout, the detached build continues in the background; reconnect after it finishes. Build progress is recorded in `%USERPROFILE%\.altium-mcp\build.log` (or the directory set by `ALTIUM_MCP_HOME`).

Clients that support `.dxt` desktop extensions can alternatively install `altium-mcp.dxt` from [releases](https://github.com/coffeenmusic/altium-mcp/releases) using their extension installer.

## Manual Server Verification

This is a local stdio server: the MCP client starts a Python process and communicates over its stdin/stdout. It has no HTTP health URL or listening port. A successful tool response checks the connection; a saved registration or an existing Python process alone does not.

### 1. Check the registered command

For Codex, run:

```powershell
codex mcp list
codex mcp get altium-mcp
```

Check that the server is enabled and that `command` and `args` point to the intended Python interpreter and repository. These commands inspect configuration; they do not start the server or prove it is responding. Without the Codex CLI, inspect the entry in the desktop app's MCP settings or `config.toml`.

### 2. Check the instance connected to your client

Open Codex with the server enabled and ask:

```text
Call the altium-mcp get_server_status tool now and show its complete JSON response.
```

The call takes no arguments and does not launch Altium or execute a script. Check these fields in the actual tool response:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `server` | `Running` means this process answered an MCP tool call. |
| `server_version` | Altium MCP project version from `pyproject.toml`, captured at startup. |
| `source_sha256` | Source fingerprint captured at startup; distinguishes local changes with the same project version. |
| `installation_path`, `server_path` | Installation and entry point used by this process. |
| `pid` | PID of the Python process answering the call. |
| `started_at`, `uptime_seconds` | Startup time in UTC and elapsed running time. |
| `python_executable`, `python_version` | Interpreter running the server, normally inside its dependency venv. |
| `mcp_sdk_version` | Installed MCP Python SDK version; this is separate from `server_version`. |
| `altium_found`, `script_found` | Whether the configured Altium executable and script project exist. |

`altium_found: true` does not mean Altium is open or scripting works. To check the Altium bridge too, open a project in Altium, focus it, then call `get_project_info` and confirm it returns that project's details. This reads project information without saving it.

If version or PID fields are absent, the client may still be running an older server. Restart or reload its MCP server and repeat the call.

### 3. Compare the running instance with files on disk

From the repository you expect to be running:

```powershell
python .\start_server.py --version
```

This prints JSON with `server_version`, `source_sha256`, `installation_path` and `server_path` without starting a server or installing dependencies. Compare it with the live `get_server_status` response. Matching paths and fingerprints mean the process's startup snapshot matches this installation's current runtime files. A different fingerprint means the files changed after startup or the client is using another copy; restart the client's server and check again.

The fingerprint covers the launcher, top-level server Python modules, bundled DelphiScript sources/projects, symbol placement rules, and dependency/version metadata. Documentation, tests, logs and user configuration are excluded. The project version alone can stay the same across local edits. `unknown` for the version or `null` for the fingerprint means the corresponding metadata could not be read.

Updating files does not reload an already running Python server. After restarting, `started_at` should change and `uptime_seconds` should reset; the PID will usually change too. Compare fingerprints again to confirm the update.

### 4. Inspect Windows processes and logs

To find the launcher and server processes:

```powershell
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name = 'python.exe' OR Name = 'pythonw.exe'" |
    Where-Object { $_.CommandLine -match 'start_server\.py|[\\/]server[\\/]main\.py' } |
    Select-Object ProcessId, ParentProcessId, ExecutablePath, CommandLine
```

Match `ProcessId` to the `pid` returned by `get_server_status` and inspect its absolute paths. The launcher and server can appear as separate processes. Multiple clients can each run their own instance, so check status through the client you are diagnosing.

From the installation directory, inspect recent server messages:

```powershell
Get-Content .\server\altium_mcp.log -Tail 60
```

The startup `Server identity` log entry includes the version, fingerprint, PID and timestamp. Log entries can belong to previous or other client sessions; use the live status call to identify the responding process.

If startup fails while dependencies are being prepared, inspect the build log:

```powershell
$altiumMcpData = if ($env:ALTIUM_MCP_HOME) { $env:ALTIUM_MCP_HOME } else { Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE '.altium-mcp' }
Get-Content (Join-Path $altiumMcpData 'build.log') -Tail 60
```

### 5. Test independently with MCP Inspector

For a manual protocol test without an AI client, use the [official MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector/blob/main/docs/cli-smoke-testing.md). Its current CLI requires Node.js 22.19.0 or newer and npm/npx. From the repository directory, use the same Python interpreter and `ALTIUM_MCP_HOME` setting as your client:

```powershell
python .\start_server.py --build
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli python .\start_server.py --method initialize --connect-timeout 60000
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli python .\start_server.py --method tools/call --tool-name get_server_status --connect-timeout 60000
```

The first Inspector command should complete the MCP handshake and report `serverInfo.name: AltiumMCP` and the project version in `serverInfo.version`. The second should return a text content block containing the status JSON described above. The initial npx run can download Inspector. If the configured Python is not on PATH, replace `python` with its quoted absolute path.

Each Inspector command starts and stops its own server instance. It tests the selected installation independently; use step 2 to inspect the instance already connected to Codex. To use Inspector's browser UI instead, run `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector python .\start_server.py`, connect to the stdio server, list its tools, and call `get_server_status` with empty arguments (`{}`).

Running `python .\start_server.py` by itself leaves it waiting for MCP messages on stdin. A quiet terminal is expected and does not verify the protocol; use Inspector or an MCP client, and use Ctrl+C to stop a manual launch.

## Launcher and Dependency Environment

`start_server.py` creates a virtual environment and pip-installs dependencies on the user's machine at first launch. This avoids bundling pre-compiled packages in `server/lib/`, which can fail when the user's Python version differs from the version used to build the bundled `.pyd` files.

**How it works:**

1. `start_server.py` (at the repo root) looks for a ready virtual environment in `%USERPROFILE%\.altium-mcp\venvs\<key>`, where `<key>` is a hash of the pinned requirements and the Python version
2. If it isn't ready, it starts a **detached** builder process (`start_server.py --build`) that creates the venv and pip-installs the dependencies, then waits for it. It installs the hash-locked `requirements.txt` when present, and falls back to the short `REQUIREMENTS` list in `start_server.py` when the file is missing or the locked dependencies cannot be installed for the interpreter. Separating the build from the launcher lets it continue if a client stops or restarts the server during setup.
3. A lock file (holding the builder's PID) makes sure only one build runs at a time; other launchers wait for it. A lock whose owner has exited is taken over immediately.
4. It then launches `server/main.py` using the venv's Python
5. Subsequent launches reuse the environment while the requirements and Python version remain unchanged

The venv, `config.json`, `build.log` and the server log `altium_mcp.log` live in `%USERPROFILE%\.altium-mcp`, not in the extension folder, because Claude Desktop replaces the extension folder on every update. The slow build therefore happens once per machine (and again only when the requirements or Python version change), and a hand-picked Altium path survives updates. AppData is deliberately avoided: Claude Desktop is an MSIX package, and writes its child processes make under AppData are redirected into `...\Packages\Claude_...\LocalCache`, so a venv built from a terminal and one built by the server would end up in different places. Set the `ALTIUM_MCP_HOME` environment variable to use a different folder. A `config.json` left beside `server/main.py` by an older version is migrated automatically on first start. The server log rotates at 1 MB (three backups) and records INFO and above; set `ALTIUM_MCP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to include every MCP protocol message.

## Optional DXT Packaging (For Developers)

The repository includes a `manifest.json` for clients that support `.dxt` desktop extensions. Packaging is optional; clients can launch the server directly as described above.

**Build steps:**

1. Make sure `start_server.py` exists at the repo root
2. Make sure `server/main.py` does NOT have the old `site.addsitedir` hack at the top
3. Keep `manifest.json` configured with `entry_point` set to `start_server.py`, no bundled-library `PYTHONPATH`, and `manifest_version: "0.3"`
4. Package the DXT by zipping the files and renaming the archive:
```powershell
Compress-Archive -Path manifest.json, start_server.py, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, server -DestinationPath altium-mcp.zip
Rename-Item altium-mcp.zip altium-mcp.dxt
```

**Do NOT include `server/lib/` or `server/.venv/` in the .dxt.** The whole point is that these are created on the user's machine.

**`start_server.py`:** use the file at the repo root as is. It is no longer reproduced here, so the two cannot drift apart.

**`manifest.json` server section:**
```json
"server": {
    "type": "python",
    "entry_point": "start_server.py",
    "mcp_config": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["${__dirname}/start_server.py"]
    }
  }
```

### Pitfalls

These are hard-won lessons from debugging DXT builds. Violating any of these will produce errors that are difficult to diagnose.

1. **Do NOT use `os.execv()` in `start_server.py`.** Installation paths can contain spaces. On Windows, `os.execv` splits the path at the space and fails. Use `sys.exit(subprocess.call([...]))` instead.

2. **Pin `mcp` to an exact version (now `==1.30.0`) and upgrade it deliberately.** An open range pulls in whatever is newest, and FastMCP has changed under the server before: 1.x dropped the `description` kwarg of `FastMCP.__init__()`, and in later 1.x releases a tool declared `-> str` sends its result a second time as `structuredContent` unless it is registered with `structured_output=False` (what `_tool()` in `main.py` does). mcp 2.x is not supported.

3. **Keep the manifest aligned with the Python launcher.** The included manifest uses `"type": "python"` with `manifest_version: "0.3"`. Check the target client's supported manifest format before changing these fields.

4. **After removing the `site.addsitedir` hack from `main.py`, fix the `pathlib.Path` reference.** The hack included `import pathlib` at the top of the file. The logging setup later uses `pathlib.Path(...)` which will throw `NameError` once that import is gone. Change it to `Path(...)` — the `from pathlib import Path` import already exists in the file, just make sure it comes before the logging setup.

5. **Do NOT bundle `server/lib/` in the DXT.** That was the old approach and defeats the purpose of the venv bootstrap.

## Configuration

On first startup, the server will automatically try to locate your Altium Designer installation. It will search for all directories that start with `C:\Program Files\Altium\AD*` and use the one with the largest revision number. If it cannot find any, you will be prompted to select the Altium executable (X2.EXE) manually when you first run the server. Altium's DelphiScript scripting is used to create an API between the MCP server and Altium.

## Available Tools

The server provides several tools to interact with Altium Designer:

### Output Jobs
- `get_output_job_containers`: Reads all available output containers from the `.OutJob` at `outjob_path` (a full path, optional) or, without one, from the first OutJob open in a project
- `run_output_jobs`: Pass a list of output job container names to run any number of them, from the `.OutJob` at `outjob_path` or the first open one. The OutJob's project must be open in Altium. PDF containers report `output_verified` once the PDF is written. If the PDF already exists and the container prompts before overwriting, Altium asks in a dialog and the run waits for the answer.
- `get_outjob_settings`: Read any `.OutJob` file from disk (no Altium needed, the OutJob does not have to be open) and return its containers (output paths, file name expression, add-to-project) and outputs (connected containers, variant, document) with decoded settings: Gerber units/format/origin and the plotted and "add to all plots" layers decoded from Altium layer IDs, NC Drill, IPC-D-356 test points, pick and place, print layers and BOM sections. Use it to audit fabrication settings before generating. Reads the saved file, so unsaved changes in Altium are not visible.

### Project & Validation
- `get_project_info`: Focused project's parameters, documents with their state (`closed` / `open` / `modified` = unsaved changes in memory), schematic sheet count and variants with their variations (e.g. Not Fitted parts). Read-only; use it to confirm nothing is unsaved before generating outputs.
- `get_project_components`: The components of the compiled project with their schematic Comment, footprint, library reference and sheet (optionally all parameters, or only the ones you name). Filter by designator (wildcards such as `R*`) or sheet; a large project comes in pages, and `next_offset` says where to go on. Use it for BOM work: the instance Comment is where generic passives keep their value, which PCB-side tools and ActiveBOM may not show.
- `get_erc_violations`: Compile the focused project in memory (nothing is saved) and list compiler/ERC violations with their level (fatal / error / warning). Violations are read from the project object - the per-document `DM_ViolationCount` does not exist in recent Altium versions.
- `get_board_summary`: Fabrication-oriented summary of the focused PCB in mm: board outline (bounding box, size, vertices) and origin, dimension objects, vias by hole size, components per side, primitive counts per layer (free vs. inside components, e.g. to see which mechanical layers hold the assembly outlines) and the free texts on both overlays.
- `get_component_primitives`: Every primitive of the given components with its layer (pads with size and solder/paste mask expansion, arcs, tracks, texts). Catches footprints that were flipped to the bottom side but kept part of their copper or mask opening on the top (e.g. fiducials).

### Component Information
- `get_all_designators`: Get a list of all component designators in the current board
- `get_all_component_property_names`: Get a list of all available component property names
- `get_component_property_values`: Get the values of a specific property for all components
- `get_component_data`: Get detailed data for specific components by designator
- `get_component_pins`: Get pin information for specified components

### Schematic/Symbol
- `get_schematic_data`: Get schematic data for specified components
- `create_schematic_symbol` ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/MMP7ZfmbCMI)): Passes pin list with pin type & coordinates to Altium script. Supports multi-part symbols (e.g. quad op-amps) via a `part_count` parameter and an `owner_part_id` field on each pin (use 0 for shared power/GND pins), active-low pin name overbars by placing a backslash after each overbarred character (e.g. `R\E\S\E\T\` renders as `RESET` with overbar), per-pin length and name/designator visibility, and an optional `graphics` list (lines, polylines, polygons, rectangles, arcs, ellipses, labels) for non-rectangular bodies like op-amp triangles and diode glyphs. When creating a symbol, the agent is instructed to first look up a similar symbol in an available library as a style reference (skipped gracefully if no library is available).
- `get_symbol_primitives`: Inventory a .SchLib (every symbol with per-type primitive counts) or dump one symbol's complete geometry (all graphics + pin details, in mils; `symbol_name="*"` dumps every symbol). Used to gap-analyze a library, to give the agent a reference example when drawing a new symbol, and to verify recreations. The symbol creator round-trips a complete production library set exactly - 514/514 symbols across IC, connector, misc, and passives libraries (dump -> recreate -> dump -> diff, zero differences). Footprint/model links (implementations) are metadata outside the graphics round-trip. Each dumped symbol also reports its Comment (`text`, `visible`) and its parameters (`name`, `value`, `visible`, location in mils as Altium holds it, `justification`, `autoposition`, `font` name and size), and each pin its `description`, its four IEEE symbols (`symbol_inside`, `symbol_inside_edge`, `symbol_outside_edge`, `symbol_outside`) and its parameters (`name`, `value`), so the agent can check symbol properties after setting them.
- `update_symbol_primitives(library_path, symbol_name, edits)`: Edit existing SchLib labels, lines, rectangles, polylines, polygons, arcs, ellipses and pins in place. `edits=[]` reads selectors; multipart targets use UIDs and/or current properties. Preserves object identity, pin numbers and model maps; never recreates symbols or saves. See [schema, E08 example and verification](dev/SYMBOL_PRIMITIVES.md).
- `create_symbols_batch`: Create or edit many symbols in one script run from a plain-text spec file. New symbols accept `SYMBOL|name|description|part_count|designator_template|component_kind`, including `J?`/`D?`/`C?` and `Standard (No BOM)`, set in the creation transaction. Optional fields retain legacy defaults. Required metadata and native readback are verified; existing-symbol edits do not require creation metadata. Use `PARAM` or `SYMPARAM` for creation parameters. See [creation requirements](dev/SYMBOL_CREATION.md). Besides `SYMBOL`, `PIN` and `GRAPHIC` records it takes:
  - `EDITSYMBOL|<name>`: edit an existing symbol. A symbol that is not in the library is reported under `failed`, never created.
  - `COMMENT|<text>[|<visible 1/0>]`: set the Comment. It is hidden unless the visible field is 1. The library editor keeps its own copy of the Comment of the symbol on screen and writes that copy back when it shows another symbol, so for that symbol the tool sets both.
  - `DESCRIPTION|<text>`: set the Description.
  - `SYMPARAM|<name>|<value>|<visible 1/0>[|x|y[|justification[|font]]]`: add or replace a symbol parameter. By default, visible parameters without a location go below the body's bottom-left corner, left-aligned, 100 mil apart in record order. The optional justification is `bottom_left`, `bottom_center`, `bottom_right`, `center_left`, `center`, `center_right`, `top_left`, `top_center` or `top_right`. The optional font is `<font name>:<size>`, for example `Arial:10`; it is looked up by name with `FontManager.GetFontID`, which adds it to the document when missing, because font IDs differ between documents. Leave a field empty to skip it and still give a later one; omitted fields keep the parameter's own. A parameter the tool positions gets Autoposition off, so Altium does not move it afterwards.
  - `PINPARAM|<pin number>|<name>|<value>`: add or replace a hidden parameter on every pin with that number (every part of a multi-part symbol).
  - `PINDESC|<pin number>|<text>`: set the Description of every pin with that number.
  - `PINSYMBOL|<pin number>|<edge>|<symbol>`: set an IEEE symbol of every pin with that number. The edge is `inside`, `inside_edge`, `outside_edge` or `outside`. The symbol is a TIeeeSymbol name without the leading `e`, in any case: `none`, `dot`, `clock`, `activelowinput`, `schmitt` and so on (the full list is in the altium-script skill, SCH_API_Reference.md, under TIeeeSymbol).

  These records work after `SYMBOL` and `EDITSYMBOL` alike. An unknown pin number, edge, symbol or justification is listed under `problems`; the rest of the batch still runs.

  The result lists `created`, `edited`, `failed` and `problems`. Created and edited symbols leave the library modified and unsaved, so the user reviews them and saves; the tool never saves a library. Objects a script adds through PreProcess/PostProcess do not reliably set Altium's modified flag (in a PCB library they never do), so the symbol and footprint tools set it themselves. A `LIBRARY|<path>` line focuses that library if it is already open (it never reloads it, which would discard unsaved symbols) and opens it otherwise. If that library cannot be focused, the batch stops before changing anything.
- `build_schematic`: Build a wired schematic on a new sheet from a circuit description: parts from a `.SchLib` (full path; `.IntLib` is not supported), wires, junctions, net labels, power ports and notes, in mils (fractions are kept, so metric positions are exact). Returns every placed pin's true connection point, so a second call can route wires from measured coordinates, and lists any part it could not place. The new sheet is kept out of your project.
- `check_schematic`: Check saved sheets for drafting problems: two-pin parts tapping their net at the pin, net labels away from their wire's free end or hanging off it, text touching wires, pins or other text (with a clear layout suggested), dangling wires, wires slightly out of level, and sheet symbol layout. Takes a `.SchDoc`, a `.PrjPcb` or a folder and reads the saved files, so it needs no running Altium. Contributed by [SiboVG](https://github.com/SiboVG) ([PR #64](https://github.com/coffeenmusic/altium-mcp/pull/64)).
- `edit_schematic`: Supports this fork's UID `add`/`update`/`delete` format on saved or open named unsaved SchDocs, plus upstream named actions (`move_component`, `add_wire`, etc.). Use `operations=[]` to read UIDs and pin connection points in mils. UID operations never save; `return_mode=summary|changed|full` controls response size, and `design_item_id=""` detaches a prototype explicitly. Named actions accept mil/mm and optional `save=True`. Do not mix formats. See [operation formats](dev/EDIT_SCHEMATIC.md). Upstream actions contributed by [SiboVG](https://github.com/SiboVG) ([PR #70](https://github.com/coffeenmusic/altium-mcp/pull/70)).
- `edit_sheet_symbols(sheet_path, operations)`: Read/create/update/delete native Sheet Symbols and replace their Sheet Entry lists. Checks exact UIDs, names, bounds, entry ownership and actual positions; never saves or creates child documents. See [hierarchy and diagram authoring](dev/SCHEMATIC_DIAGRAM.md).
- `draw_block_diagram(sheet_path, blocks, links, notes)`: Draw non-electrical rectangles, text and orthogonal arrows on an exact SchDoc, including explicit detours. Validates all blocks/routes before editing, returns primitive UIDs and verified native geometry, and never saves. See [schema and live verification](dev/SCHEMATIC_DIAGRAM.md).
- `get_symbol_placement_rules`: Read this fork's pin-placement and creation-metadata guidance from `server\symbol_placement_rules.txt`. Keep a copy of local customizations before updating.
- `set_library_component_data`: Read or upsert parameters, Comment/description and PCB footprint models on an exact existing SchLib symbol, including complete pin-to-pad maps and one-to-many mappings. Checks symbol pins and actual PcbLib pads before editing, preserves unrelated models, verifies readback and never saves. See [schema, limits and examples](dev/LIBRARY_COMPONENT_DATA.md).
- `set_library_component_properties(library_path, symbol_name, designator_template=None, component_kind=None)`: Set native library designator templates (`J?`, `D?`, `C?`) and Component Type, including `Standard (No BOM)`. Omitted fields are preserved; no placed-component updates or saves. See [supported kinds and verification](dev/LIBRARY_COMPONENT_PROPERTIES.md).
- `remove_empty_library_component(library_path, component_name, dry_run=False)`: Remove an exact genuinely empty SchLib/PcbLib member, such as `Component_1` / `PCBComponent_1`, after checking all children and meaningful metadata. Supports named unsaved libraries, protects the last member and populated components, verifies survivors, and never saves. See [empty criteria and verification](dev/EMPTY_LIBRARY_COMPONENT.md).
- `set_library_view(library_path, component_name=None, part_id=None, display_mode=None, fit=True, view_mode=None, camera=None)`: Select an exact symbol/section/display mode or footprint, fit its view, and dispatch native PcbLib 2D/3D and camera presets. Preserves content, Modified and files. Selection has native readback; fit/mode/camera verification is explicitly dispatch-only. See [presets, M01 workflow and live checks](dev/LIBRARY_VIEW.md).
- `get_library_components_data(library_paths, component_names=None, fields=None, offset=0, limit=50)`: Batch-read one or several SchLib/PcbLib buffers in one native run: parameters, native Designator/ComponentKind, pins, model/pin-pad bindings, Height and Top/Bottom testpoint flags. Select fields and pages; preserves dirty buffers, member/part selection and files, and restores the previous document view. See [schema, scope and examples](dev/LIBRARY_COMPONENTS_DATA.md).
- `validate_library_components(library_paths, component_names=None, rules=None, pad_roles=None, offset=0, limit=50, max_issues=500)`: Check required metadata, pin maps/grid, pad dimensions, copper/NPTH clearances, annular rings, mask webs and paste. Classifies electrical/shield/NPTH contacts, checks linked footprints outside the selected page, and reports unresolved rules/geometry explicitly. Read-only; never saves. See [rules, coverage and examples](dev/LIBRARY_VALIDATION.md).
- `verify_library_roundtrip(library_paths, save=False, max_differences=100, coordinate_tolerance_mils=0.001)`: Compare whole SchLib/PcbLib buffers across real close/reopen: geometry, parameters, bindings and STEP evidence. Default mode requires saved clean libraries and never saves. Explicit `save=True` backs up and saves only the requested libraries; dirty-buffer STEP gaps remain explicit. See [save policy, comparison scope and verification](dev/LIBRARY_ROUNDTRIP.md).
- `get_lcsc_component_info(query="", qty=1, limit=5, manufacturer="", exact_mpn="", include_historical=True, historical_url="", queries=None)`: Read single/batch LCSC cards with strict manufacturer/full order-MPN filters, sale status, technical parameters and quantity pricing. Recovers public historical cards with explicit source/availability errors and no guessed stock/prices; no Altium operation. `set_library_component_lcsc_data(library_path, symbol_name, lcsc_id, qty=1)` writes the existing supplier fields only when the symbol's MP matches. See [LCSC lookup, batch and recovery contracts](dev/LCSC_COMPONENT_DATA.md).
- `create_document(document_path, document_kind=None)`: Create a named unsaved SchDoc/PcbDoc/SchLib/PcbLib in Free Documents; rejects existing files/open documents. Never saves or includes it in a project automatically.
- `save_document(document_path, dry_run=False)`: Save only one exact open document at its assigned local path, when the user authorizes saving. `dry_run=True` validates without writing. Returns native status and disk SHA-256 verification; never invokes Save All or saves a project.
- `close_document(document_path, require_clean=True)`: Close an exact document or PrjPcb/LibPkg without saving. Refuses Modified targets by default; project preflight checks all open source/generated documents before closing any. `require_clean=False` explicitly discards unsaved changes. Repeated closes are idempotent. See [policy, results and verification](dev/CLOSE_DOCUMENT.md).
- `clone_schematic_components(source_sheet, target_sheet, designators)`: Copy selected placed components and all their placed multipart sections between exact SchDocs, preserving instance data/pose/models and assigning fresh UIDs. Rejects target designator collisions before editing; copies no external wiring and never saves. Supports open named unsaved sheets. See [contract and verification](dev/SCHEMATIC_CLONING.md).
- `set_schematic_sheet_properties(sheet_path, sheet_size=None)`: Read/change standard A0..A4 size on an exact saved or open named unsaved SchDoc, with undo notifications, Modified/readback checks and no saves.
- `zoom_schematic(sheet_path, mode="all")`: Fit schematic objects (`all`) or the page (`sheet`) in the exact sheet's viewport; preserves Modified and never saves.
- `save_project(project_path, dry_run=False)`: Save only an exact open local PrjPcb/LibPkg after clean-source and membership preflight; verify disk membership and unchanged source files. `dry_run=True` writes nothing. Live-tested only in dry-run mode under the user's no-save constraint. See [report analysis, contracts and live evidence](dev/POWER_SEQUENCER_SCRIPT_REPLACEMENTS.md).
- `add_document_to_project(project_path, document_path)`: Include one saved or open named unsaved document in an exact open PrjPcb/LibPkg, idempotently and without saving documents/project. See [lifecycle behavior, examples and limits](dev/DOCUMENT_MANAGEMENT.md).
- `select_project(project_path)`: Make one exact already-open PrjPcb/LibPkg current through Altium's project API. Does not open/reload sheets, compile or save; verifies project identity and unchanged document states. See [behavior, examples and live verification](dev/PROJECT_SELECTION.md).
- `open_project(project_path)`: Open and select an exact existing PrjPcb/LibPkg, or reuse it if already open. Never reloads an open project or requests saving/compilation. `open_document(document_path)` opens/focuses SchLib/PcbLib libraries and SchDoc/PcbDoc documents while preserving already-open in-memory data. See [opening behavior and examples](dev/OPEN_TARGETS.md).
- `get_schematic_connectivity(sheet_path, compiled=True, expected_connections=None)`: Read active pin numbers, electrical-end coordinates in mils and actual flattened net names from the owning Altium project's compiler model. The default compiles in memory; `compiled=False` reads the existing cache and marks it potentially stale. Reports placed pins missing from the compiler model with an unknown net. Optional expected pin groups check common nets, net names, disconnection or exact membership on the target sheet. Never saves sheets. See [schema, examples, alternatives and verification](dev/SCHEMATIC_CONNECTIVITY.md).
- `get_library_symbol_reference`: Create symbol's helper tool to use an open library symbol as an example to create the symbol
- `search_library_symbol`: Search for a symbol by name in a schematic library (.SchLib) and navigate to it. Supports partial name matching. Will open the library file in Altium if a path is provided, or show a file picker if not.

Library paths (`library_path`, `LIBRARY|`, `FPLIB|`) may contain commas and may be spelled in a different case or with forward slashes. An open library is matched to its path after normalizing case and separators, so the tools never open a second copy of it.

### Layout Operations
- `get_all_nets`: Returns a list of unique nets from the pcb
- `create_net_class` ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/89booqRbnzQ)): Create a net class from a list of nets
- `get_pcb_layers`: Get detailed layer information including electrical, mechanical, layer pairs, etc.
- `get_pcb_layer_stackup`: Gets stackup info like dielectric, layer thickness, etc.
- `set_pcb_layer_visibility` ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/XaWs5A6-h30)): Turn on or off any group of layers. For example turn on inner layers. Turn off silk.
- `get_pcb_rules`: Gets the rule descriptions for all pcb rules in layout.
- `run_drc`: Run Altium's design rule check on a board and list the violations, each with its rule, description, position and the objects involved, plus the per-rule counts from Altium's report. The Design Rule Checker dialog flashes on screen while the tool presses Run; `ran` says whether the check really ran. Takes an optional `board_path`. Contributed by [SiboVG](https://github.com/SiboVG) ([PR #66](https://github.com/coffeenmusic/altium-mcp/pull/66)).
- `create_pcb_rule`: Add a design rule: clearance, width, hole size, routing via, solder or paste mask expansion, or polygon connect, with values in mils and Altium query scopes such as `InNet('GND')`. A rule added by script becomes priority 1 of its kind, so give it a narrow scope; the result warns when a rule scoped to everything now overrides others. Takes an optional `board_path`. Contributed by [SiboVG](https://github.com/SiboVG) ([PR #67](https://github.com/coffeenmusic/altium-mcp/pull/67)).
- `get_selected_components_coordinates`: Get position, rotation, layer, and footprint information for currently selected components
- `move_components`: Move specified components by X and Y offsets
- `set_component_position`: Set one component's absolute position and rotation
- `place_components`: Batch absolute placement - place any number of components (x, y, rotation, top/bottom layer) in a single transaction / one undo step. The workhorse for AI-driven placement.
- `check_placement`: Verify a placement - finds overlaps and clearance violations against every other component on the board using true primitive-to-primitive distances (designator text excluded). Run after placing; a screenshot is not verification.
- `check_orientation`: Advisory check for 2-pad passives whose rotation could be improved (e.g. a decoupling cap with its GND pad facing away from the IC). Geometry only - review suggestions with judgement; parts like pull-ups don't care.
- `get_net_connections`: For the nets touching a set of components, list every pad on each net board-wide with per-net airline (MST) lengths - the data behind connectivity-driven placement (shorten critical nets, see off-cluster loads and filter banks).
- `check_routing`: Check the routed copper for segments that are not 0, 45 or 90 degrees and for right-angle and acute corners, with the net, layer and position of each. Run after editing tracks or vias; a screenshot does not show a stub 2 degrees off 45. Contributed by [SiboVG](https://github.com/SiboVG) ([PR #60](https://github.com/coffeenmusic/altium-mcp/pull/60)).
- `route_track`: Add a track through waypoints with every segment exactly 0, 45 or 90 degrees, optionally chamfering square corners; `dry_run` only returns the segments. It adds tracks only: no vias and no DRC. Contributed by [SiboVG](https://github.com/SiboVG) ([PR #60](https://github.com/coffeenmusic/altium-mcp/pull/60)).
- `place_vias`: Add vias at positions in mils from the board origin, with a default size, net and layer span that each via can override (blind and buried vias too). Every net and layer is checked against the board first, by Altium's layer name or the stack's own ("Inner 1"), so a bad entry adds nothing, and all the vias are one undo step. Takes an optional `board_path`. Contributed by [SiboVG](https://github.com/SiboVG) ([PR #68](https://github.com/coffeenmusic/altium-mcp/pull/68)).
- `place_polygon_pour`: Add a polygon pour from an outline of corners in mils on a signal layer, solid or hatched, with an optional net, and pour it. Takes an optional `board_path`. Contributed by [SiboVG](https://github.com/SiboVG) ([PR #69](https://github.com/coffeenmusic/altium-mcp/pull/69)).
- `place_cutout`: Add a polygon pour cutout on one signal layer or all of them, or a board cutout, and repour the polygons it overlaps. Takes an optional `board_path`. Contributed by [SiboVG](https://github.com/SiboVG) ([PR #69](https://github.com/coffeenmusic/altium-mcp/pull/69)).
- `layout_duplicator` ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/HD-A_8iVV70)): Starts layout duplication assuming you have already selected the source components on the PCB.
- `layout_duplicator_apply`: Action #2 of `layout_duplicator`. Agent will use part info automatically to predict the match between source and destination components, then will send those matches to the place script.

The cool thing about layout duplication this way as opposed to with Altium's built in layout replication, is that the exact components don't have to match because the LLM can look through the descriptions and understand which components match and which don't have a match. That's something that can't really be hard coded.

### Silkscreen
Bulk placement with the Silkscreen Auto Placer script, then an agent cleans up what it leaves. The loop is: auto-place, find what needs work, look at it, pick a spot, apply, and get Altium's verdict.
- `auto_place_silkscreen`: Run the [Silkscreen Auto Placer](https://github.com/coffeenmusic/Silkscreen_Auto_Placer) headless inside Altium (`server/AltiumScript/silk_autoplacer.pas`, a port of the GUI script): autopositions on an offset grid with shrinking text, a retry pass and a 2nd-pass wiggle search, avoiding pads, bodies, silk and optionally vias. Options default to the settings last saved by the script's GUI (`AutoPlaceSilkscreen.ini`); any argument overrides them. Failures are centred on their part (or hidden/restored). One undo step. Differences from the GUI script: "try altered rotation" on the bottom layer flips 0/270 (the script turned mirrored text to 90/180, upside down); labels keep the Board Outline Clearance rule's distance from the board edge (the script only kept them on the board); and each placed designator's geometry is rebuilt at the end (see below). Save the board first: a run touches every designator, and Altium crashed once during one (not reproduced).
- `check_silkscreen`: What needs work. Each designator is tested with Altium's own Silk To Silk, Silk To Solder Mask and Board Outline Clearance rules (`Rule.ActualCheck`, the same test a batch DRC runs), plus quality problems DRC does not flag: text far from its part (noting when it is still in line with it, as in a label block), reading as another same-type part's label, over a part body or left on top of its own part, over open vias, off the board, or upside down. Lists hidden designators too. Optional whole-board view.
- `view_silkscreen`: Look at an area - designators or a mil region - rendered cleanly (mask openings, silk, part names, designator boxes) with a grid labelled in board coordinates, so a free spot can be read straight off the image. Independent of Altium's window and zoom.
- `get_designator_options`: Ranked legal spots for designators, drawn as numbered boxes, each clear of silk, mask openings, open vias, the board edge and every other designator, readable, and nearer its own part than any same-type part (or level with its own part when a nearer part is not). When there is none, says what blocks it. Can include smaller-text options (`min_height_mils`). Ask for a designator together with its neighbours: the designators asked about are not obstacles to each other, so their labels can move to make room.
- `get_label_block_options`: For parts in a row whose designators do not fit next to them: their designators in a row too, in the same order, where there is room, even some way off. Give one designator to use its whole row (parts side by side along x or y, similar size, gaps up to 50 mil; mounting holes, fiducials and hidden test points get no label) or list the parts; a single part works as a block of one. Each option is a block (labels across the row, in line with each part when the pitch allows or side by side; or end to end along it) and, unless it sits right against the row, a link: a silk leader line with an arrowhead pointing at the parts, or matching index markers - a capital letter in a circle, then square, then triangle - next to the block and next to the parts. Drawn per option.
- `place_label_block`: Apply an option: the labels move (shown, at the block's text size), the link is drawn on the overlay as free tracks, arcs and text, and both are checked with Altium's silk rules. Replaces an earlier block of the same parts. Blocks are recorded per board (`C:\Users\Public\altium_mcp\silk_label_blocks.json`, never next to the board), so `check_silkscreen` knows a block's labels are linked to their parts and reports a block whose labels or link have been disturbed. `remove_label_block` deletes a block's link.
- `remove_label_block`: Remove the label block of some parts: its link graphics (leader or index markers) are deleted, and the designators stay where they are, ready to be placed again.

Designators are not hidden to get rid of problems: only mounting holes and fiducials go without one. A designator with no room goes in a label block.
- `set_designator_positions`: Place designators by coordinates (text-box centre) or relative to their part (`side` = above/below/left/right/inside, `gap`, `offset`), with optional rotation, height, stroke width and visibility. `dry_run` checks a set of neighbours together without touching the board; otherwise all moves are one undo step and each moved designator comes back with Altium's DRC verdict. Moves are tied to the board they were computed for: if another PCB has been focused since, Altium refuses them and nothing moves (`check_silkscreen` reports which board it read).

Typical run on a dense two-sided board (845 parts, 804 visible designators): the auto placer placed 725 in about 7 minutes. Many of its labels still touched each other, because the script tolerates a 4 mil designator overlap, or sat far from their part. Agent rounds of `check_silkscreen` → `get_designator_options` → `set_designator_positions` (dry run, then apply), allowing 25 mil text, took the board from 637 silk DRC violations to 367. The rest are designators with no legal spot in the densest passive fields; those go in label blocks.

The geometry model lives in `server/silkscreen.py` and label blocks in `server/label_blocks.py` (pure Python; unit tests in `server/tests/test_silkscreen.py` and `test_label_blocks.py` run without Altium). The links are drawn by the `edit_silk_graphics` bridge command, which adds or removes free overlay tracks, arcs and centred stroke text in one undo step and checks each new primitive with the silk rules. Altium's Silk To Silk rule only checks text against other silk (a free track crossing another free track or arc passes), so a marker letter must clear its shape. It measures stroke text by its ink: Altium's bounding box runs half a stroke beyond the strokes, and its silk rules check the strokes. The Board Outline Clearance rule is the exception: it measures from the bounding box, and its text clearance comes from the rule's per-object table (`GetClearance(eObjectClearanceID_Text, eObjectClearanceID_OutlineEdge)`), not its generic Gap.

Altium pitfalls the tools work around:
- Batch DRC checks a cached copy of each text's stroke geometry, and a scripted move or resize does not refresh it. The batch DRC then reports collisions where the text used to be and can miss them where it is now (on the test board, 457 phantom silk-to-silk hits, while every label passed `Rule.ActualCheck`). `set_designator_positions` and `auto_place_silkscreen` rebuild each designator they touch with `SetState_XSizeYSize` inside Begin/EndModify. Text moved by other scripts, such as the GUI auto placer, probably has the same problem (not tested).
- `Pad.BoundingRectangleOnLayer(solder mask)` can be offset from the pad for some custom pad shapes (a SOT-89 tab was 55 mil off). The export takes the union with the pad's own bounding rectangle and flags the pad, and the model then treats it as a plain rectangle.

### PCB Footprint Library
- `create_pcb_footprint`: Create a new PCB footprint in the currently active .PcbLib document. Supports SMD pads (Rect, Round, Oval shapes) defined in mm relative to the component origin. Auto-generates a courtyard on Mech 15 and silkscreen with a pin 1 indicator (gap in the top-left corner), or accepts explicit courtyard dimensions. Contributed by [coffeedust](https://github.com/coffeedust) ([PR #7](https://github.com/coffeenmusic/altium-mcp/pull/7)).
- `get_footprint_primitives`: Inventory a .PcbLib (per-footprint primitive counts) or dump complete footprint geometry - pads with full stack/hole detail, tracks, arcs, fills, texts, regions - in mils, relative to the footprint origin (also for the footprint shown in the editor). Pads also report their paste and solder mask mode and expansion and whether they are `locked`. The reference source when recreating or verifying footprints. A dumped footprint also lists its 3D bodies (`bodies_3d`: model file, whether it is embedded, its X/Y offset, standoff and overall height, layer, model rotation X/Y/Z and Z offset); the bodies themselves are not recreated. The rotations and Z offset are read from the saved library file, because `IPCB_Model.GetState` returns them through out parameters that DelphiScript never receives. A body that is not saved yet has them as null (`placement` says which).
- `edit_footprint_model3d(library_path, footprint_name, ..., changes=None, delete=False)`: Inventory, move, rotate, embed, replace STEP or delete existing 3D bodies without saving. Select by live body ID or guarded index. Rotation/Z edits require a complete pose because DelphiScript cannot read those out-parameters. See [contract and verification](dev/FOOTPRINT_MODEL3D.md).
- `set_footprint_properties(library_path, footprint_name, height_mm=None)`: Read/set native footprint Height in mm, with idempotent updates, Modified/readback checks and no saves. Preserves primitives and 3D bodies; `get_footprint_primitives` also reports `height_mm`. See [contract and verification](dev/FOOTPRINT_PROPERTIES.md).
- `set_footprint_pad_settings`: Set manual solder mask/paste expansions on exact existing PcbLib pads, or reset both to rules. Uses the pad cache, preflights names, verifies readback and never saves.
- `set_footprint_pad_properties(library_path, footprint_name, pad_names, is_testpoint_top=None, is_testpoint_bottom=None)`: Read/set native Top/Bottom testpoint flags on selected pads. Checks every target and copper side before editing; preserves omitted flags, geometry, locks and mask/paste settings. Never saves. See [contract and verification](dev/FOOTPRINT_PAD_PROPERTIES.md).
- `edit_footprint_primitives`: Change layers of existing tracks, arcs and fills selected by complete geometry. Preflights the entire batch; preserves geometry and never saves. See [contracts, report analysis and live-test status](dev/FOOTPRINT_EDITOR.md).
- `get_pcb_api_constants`: Read a whitelist of native shape, cache and layer enum values without arbitrary script evaluation.
- `create_footprints_batch(spec_file, units="mil")`: Create many footprints in one script run. Choose `mm` or legacy-default `mil` for all linear input fields. `FOOTPRINT|name|description|height` sets native Height; PAD fields after mask expansion set Top/Bottom testpoint flags. Creation properties are preflighted and verified without follow-up setters or saves. Supports pads/stacks/holes, graphics, regions, vias and STEP offsets. See [units, schema and verification](dev/FOOTPRINT_CREATION.md). Records beyond the original set:
  - `PAD|...|bot_shape|paste_mode|paste_expansion|mask_mode|mask_expansion[|testpoint_top|testpoint_bottom]`: optional paste/mask overrides, then native testpoint flags. Modes are TMaskExpansionMode ints: 1 rule, 2 manual (expansion in the selected input unit). Mode 0 (no mask) cannot be set on a pad by script and is reported as a problem. Manual values use the pad cache; testpoint flags use 1/0 with blank/omitted False.
  - `MODEL3D|<STEP file>|<layer>|<rot_x>|<rot_y>|<rot_z>|<z_offset>[|<x>|<y>[|<embed 1/0>]]`: add a 3D body from a STEP file, embedded unless embed is 0.
  - `EDITFOOTPRINT|<name>`: add `MODEL3D` records to an existing footprint; it never creates a footprint, and other records under it are reported and ignored.

  Altium keeps the footprint shown in the library editor on the library board, offset by the library origin, and writes it back when another footprint is shown. So a model for the shown footprint is added to the board, at that offset; added to the footprint itself, it would be lost. Round-trip verified against complete production SMD and through-hole libraries. Like `create_symbols_batch`, it leaves the library modified and unsaved, and an `FPLIB|<path>` line focuses the open library rather than reloading it.

### Both
- `get_screenshot`: Capture an Altium view as an image: `pcb`, `sch`, `pcblib` or `schlib`. Both library modes passed live validation. Focus the exact library with `open_document` first. For PCB views only, an optional `zoom_to` list of designators zooms to those components. The document kind and foreground activation are checked before capturing the composed desktop, including Altium's GPU canvas. Altium comes to the front briefly, then the previous window regains focus.

### Scripting / Development
- `run_altium_script`: Run a DelphiScript snippet in an **isolated sandbox** and get back a step-by-step log, the script's result, and - when a script fails - Altium's own error message with the line in your script. Each run is written to a fresh copy of `SandboxScript/Sandbox.pas` with a unique file name and started with `ScriptingSystem:RunScriptFile`, so a script that failed earlier can never be re-run from Altium's script editor. Errors inside the script (undeclared identifiers, calls on nil, bad conversions) are caught and reported without blocking Altium; syntax errors are reported from Altium's error dialog, which the tool answers before stopping the debugger (`-REditScript:Stop`) and confirming with a probe run that the next script will work. The other MCP tools recover the same way when one of their own commands gets stuck. Only scripts the MCP started are ever stopped: a script you are running or debugging in Altium is left alone, and the tool says Altium is busy instead. Scripts may start with their own `var` block; assignments to undeclared names are refused before Altium is called. The template provides `MM()`, `OpenSchDoc()` and `SaveDoc()` helpers. While waiting it closes blocking Altium dialogs (only windows owned by `X2.EXE`) and returns their titles in `dismissed_dialog_titles` - close your own Altium dialogs before running scripts, since an open dialog of yours may be closed too.
- `ensure_altium_script_skill`: Check whether the [altium-script skill](https://github.com/coffeenmusic/altium-scripts-skill) (Altium DelphiScript API reference, examples, and conventions) is installed, and install it on request. Skills load at client startup, so a newly installed skill appears after a restart.

### Server Status
- `get_server_status`: Read the responding process's project/SDK versions, startup source fingerprint, PID, start time, uptime, interpreter and configured Altium/script paths. See [manual server verification](#manual-server-verification).

## How It Works

The server communicates with Altium Designer using a scripting bridge:

1. It writes command requests to `C:\Users\Public\altium_mcp\request.json`
2. It launches Altium with instructions to run the bridge script: the units of `server/AltiumScript/Altium_API.PrjScr` merged into one file in `C:\Users\Public\altium_mcp\bridge`, named after its content so Altium never runs a stale copy it still holds open (`ScriptingSystem:RunScriptFile`)
3. The script processes the request and writes results to `C:\Users\Public\altium_mcp\response.json`
4. The server reads and returns the response

**Why one merged file, not the script project.** Running a script *project* (`ScriptingSystem:RunScript` with `ProjectName`) makes Altium create a hidden copy of every form in the script projects on the user's menus, and never free it. On one machine with 14 such forms that was about 105 Windows USER objects per call. Windows caps a process at 10,000 (`USERProcessHandleQuota`). Near the cap Altium shows "System Error. Code: 1158 ... used all of its system allowance of handles for Window Manager objects" and then crashes, losing unsaved work, after about 90 calls. Running a single script file (`RunScriptFile`) or script text (`RunScriptText`) leaks nothing, so `server/script_bundle.py` merges the units into one file: global `var`/`const` blocks first, then each routine after the routines it calls (a single file must define a routine before its first use). The bundle is rebuilt whenever a unit changes. The project is still the source to edit, and the fallback if bundling fails.

When adding bridge code: start every routine, and its `begin` and final `end;`, at column 0, and don't let routines call each other in a cycle (the bundle has no forward declarations). `tests/test_script_bundle.py` checks the real units. The sandbox runs its script as a file too.

Altium's script engine also leaks memory: every property read of a board object costs roughly 100-200 bytes that are never freed. On a 40,000-object board that is about 25 MB per silkscreen export and 50 MB per full silkscreen check, so a long session of exports grows Altium by gigabytes until it runs out of memory and dies with unsaved work. The bridge scripts read each object's properties once and skip objects early; the silkscreen tools reuse one board export for up to 15 minutes and update it themselves after their own moves and link graphics.

As a backstop, the server checks Altium before every call and refuses when it is within 1,000 USER objects of the cap (the user's own menu scripts still leak each time they run) or using more than half of the machine's RAM, asking for a save and restart.

Files exchanged with the scripts are read and written the way Altium does: in the Windows ANSI code page, or as UTF-8 when the file starts with a byte-order mark.
