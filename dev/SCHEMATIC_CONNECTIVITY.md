# get_schematic_connectivity

```python
get_schematic_connectivity(sheet_path, compiled=True, expected_connections=None)
```

Returns active pin numbers, electrical connection coordinates and actual
compiled net names for one schematic sheet. Optionally checks expected
connections. Never edits or saves sheets or clears their Modified flag.

## Existing alternatives

| Tool | Provides | Missing capability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `get_net_connections` | PCB pad connectivity | Current schematic data |
| `get_schematic_data` | Schematic component data | Full sheet-specific pin-to-net map |
| `edit_schematic(path, [])` | Editor objects and pin coordinates | Compiled nets |
| `get_project_components` | Compiled project components | Pin-to-net map |
| `get_erc_violations` | Compiler/ERC diagnostics | Expected-connection checks |
| `dev/netlist.py`, `dev/check_connectivity.pas` | Geometric checks | Compiler authority; limited hierarchy, port and mirrored-symbol handling |

The implementation uses Workspace Manager's `DM_Compile`,
`DM_DocumentFlattened`, `DM_Pins`, `DM_PinNumber`, `DM_FlattenedNetName`,
`DM_PartUniqueId` and coordinates. It never infers nets from drawing proximity.
See the [official Workspace Manager API](https://www.altium.com/documentation/altium-dxp-developer/workspace-manager-api).

## Sheet selection and compilation

`sheet_path` must be an absolute path to an existing `.SchDoc` belonging to
exactly one open `.PrjPcb`. Ownership is resolved by exact path, independently
of UI focus. A file shared by multiple open projects is rejected because its
networks may depend on the owning project.

A closed sheet is opened for reading. An open sheet is reused without reloading
it from disk, preserving unsaved changes. An active editor transaction blocks
the operation.

- `compiled=True`: explicitly compile the owning project in memory, then read
  its model. Returns `compile_performed=true`, `may_be_stale=false`.
- `compiled=False`: read the existing compiler cache without explicitly
  compiling. Returns `compile_performed=false`, `may_be_stale=true` and a warning.
  Nets and coordinates may predate unsaved edits. If no model exists, the call
  fails and requests `compiled=True`.

Compilation may update derived Altium data such as `.PrjPcbStructure`; it does
not save `.SchDoc` files or repair project errors.

## Response

`success` means retrieval succeeded, not that the expected circuit matched.
The response includes `sheet_path`, `project_path`, `saved=false`,
`was_modified`, `is_modified`, compilation/cache flags,
`coordinate_units="mils"`, `net_source="altium_workspace_manager"`,
`pins`, `nets` and `warnings`.

Each `pins` record contains:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `index` | Record index in this response, not a persistent ID |
| `designator`, `logical_designator` | Physical instance and logical designators |
| `component_uid` | Source component UID on the sheet |
| `pin_number`, `pin_name` | Pin number and name; numbers are strings, so `01` differs from `1` |
| `part_id`, `instance_id` | Component part and full compiled pin instance ID |
| `x`, `y` | Electrical connection point in mils |
| `net_name`, `net_id` | Actual flattened net name and key within the current project model |
| `logical_net_name` | Local net name from the model, when available |
| `resolution` | Mapping/net resolution status |
| `coordinate_source` | `compiled_model` or `schematic_editor` |
| `editor_x`, `editor_y`, `geometry_matches` | Coordinate comparison with the editor for matched model records |

Compiler coordinates take precedence. Editor geometry supplies comparison data
and coordinates for pins missing from the model; it never determines their net.
For mirrored or complex symbols, `geometry_matches=false` needs investigation,
not replacement of compiler data with a geometric guess.

Only the placed symbol's active part and display mode are inventoried, including
shared pins with `OwnerPartId=0`. Unused alternative parts are excluded.

Each `nets` record includes `net_id`, `net_name`, local `pin_indexes`,
`sheet_pin_count` and `project_pin_count`. The latter counts pins enumerated by
the entire flattened project model, exposing cross-sheet connectivity through
ports, power and hierarchy without returning all remote endpoints.

`net_id` equals the flattened name in the current model. Automatically generated
names may change after edits and recompilation; do not treat them as permanent IDs.

## Unknown nets and coverage

Live editor pins are reconciled with compiler records by component UID, pin
number and part. Pins are retained even when absent from the compiler model.

| `resolution` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `resolved` | Matching compiler record and net found |
| `not_in_compiled_model` | Placed pin has no compiler record; `net_name=null` |
| `not_assigned` | Compiler returned an empty name or `?` |
| `ambiguous_model` | Contradictory records share one pin identity; no net is chosen |

`placed_pin_count` and `model_pin_count` describe the two inventories.
`missing_model_pin_count` counts placed pins absent from the model;
`unresolved_pin_count` counts output records without an unambiguous net.
`model_only_pins` contains compiler pins not matched to editor pins.
`complete=false` indicates missing/unresolved records or fatal compiler errors.

`compile_errors`, `compile_fatals` and `compile_warnings` report compiler counts.
Use `get_erc_violations` for details. `complete=true` does not certify electrical
correctness or replace ERC. `checks.passed` covers only the supplied expectations;
unrelated coverage gaps remain in the response.

## Expected connections

```python
get_schematic_connectivity(
    sheet_path=r"C:\Projects\Board\Display.SchDoc",
    compiled=True,
    expected_connections=[
        # Check one pin's actual net name.
        {"pins": [{"designator": "C2", "pin_number": "1"}],
         "net_name": "TMDS_D2_N"},
        # Both pins must share a net.
        {"pins": [{"designator": "R10", "pin_number": "2"},
                  {"designator": "U1", "pin_number": "3"}]},
        # Reject additional pins on this sheet only.
        {"pins": [{"designator": "R11", "pin_number": "1"},
                  {"designator": "C10", "pin_number": "2"}],
         "net_name": "FILTER_OUT", "exact": True},
        # Both pins must belong to different known nets.
        {"pins": [{"designator": "U1", "pin_number": "1"},
                  {"designator": "U1", "pin_number": "2"}],
         "connected": False}
    ]
)
```

The R/U designators illustrate the schema; use actual project endpoints.
Defaults: `connected=true`, `exact=false`. Optional `net_name` checks every
listed pin. Designators and expected net names are case-insensitive; pin
numbers are exact strings.

To disambiguate a selector, add `component_uid`, `part_id` or `instance_id` from
a fresh response. Include only populated fields: omit `instance_id=null` for
unresolved pins. Zero or multiple matches fail the check. Repeated channels are
not merged solely by logical designator.

`connected=false` requires exactly two pins and forbids `net_name` and
`exact=true`. Unknown nets cannot prove disconnection and fail the check.
A single pin requires `net_name` or `exact=true`. Selecting the same pin twice
is rejected. Limits: 1000 checks, 2000 selectors per check. Unknown fields and
invalid types are rejected before calling Altium.

`checks` contains `passed`, `checked_count`, `failed_count`,
`compile_performed`, `scope="sheet"` and per-check results with `issues`:

| Issue | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `missing_pin`, `ambiguous_pin` | Selector did not identify exactly one pin |
| `duplicate_resolved_pin` | Different selectors identified the same pin |
| `unresolved_net` | Actual net could not be established |
| `different_nets` | Expected connection is absent |
| `unexpected_net` | Actual net name differs |
| `unexpected_connection` | Forbidden connection exists |
| `unexpected_members` | Additional pins on the target sheet share the net |

`exact=true` checks only the target sheet. Remote GND endpoints do not count as
unexpected members. This is not a project-wide membership check or a complete
short-circuit audit.

## Tests and client refresh

```powershell
python -m unittest server.tests.test_schematic_connectivity -v
python dev/test_schematic_connectivity_live.py --sheet 'C:\Projects\Board\Display.SchDoc' --second-sheet 'C:\Projects\Board\Interfaces.SchDoc'
```

The live test requires the MCP Python environment and a running Altium project.
It only reads: compares compiler/editor coordinates, valid/invalid expectations,
cache behavior, sheet switching, object snapshots, Modified flags and SHA-256
hashes of all project `.SchDoc` files. Add `--expected <file.json>` for an
independently prepared `expected_connections` array. Artifacts and fresh PrjScr
copies used to bypass Altium's script cache stay under the toolkit's
`.altium-mcp/schematic_connectivity_<timestamp>` directory.

Restart the MCP connection to refresh its tool catalog. If Altium retains old
script buffers, reopen `Altium_API.PrjScr` without saving stale buffers over the
updated files. See the [live test report](SCHEMATIC_CONNECTIVITY_LIVE_TEST.md).
